# Programming-Assignment-3
## This Assignment aims to test the students in the usage of the pandas library and how to utilize the different functions in handling the different data in dataframes. The assignment has two problems with the 2nd problem being seperated into different parts
## For the first problem the goal is to load a downloaded csv file as Cars. The first and last 5 rows are then displayed through the use of the heads and tails functions which displays the first and last 5 rows respectively.

For the 2nd problem it is seperated into 4 parts and the use of indexing, slicing and subsetting is tested.
For the first part the goal is to display the first five rows with odd number columns, this was done through the use of the iloc function to specify the rows and columns that should be displayed.

The goal of the second part in problem 2 is to show and display the row that has the model Mazda RX4 and was accomplished using slicing to extract the specific part and row which has the Mazda RX4.

In the third part of the problem the goal is to display how many cylinders the car Camaro Z28 has. It was accomplished using the loc function which first searches which row has the Model and then adter searching for the row the next part of the code printer which column of the row to print.

In the last part of the problem the task is to show and display the number of cylinders and gears that the cars Mazda RX4, Ford Pantera L, and the Honda Civic. It was accomplished using the both the concat and iloc functions similarly to how the problem in the previous part was accomplished the only difference is how many columns and rows to show. The concat function was also used to display the rows at the same time.
